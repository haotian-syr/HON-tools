<center><h1>  Moise  </h1>
A Topology Package for Maple 


</center>

<br> <br> Moise is a collection of Maple functions for doing
calculations in combinatorial topology.  I started it in 1989 on an
IBM PC in Gbasic. Now it exists as a Maple worksheet. Currently Moise
can compute homology groups and perform some operations with
simplicial complexes. Moise is not designed to be an optimal way to do
these calculations, but it can do some things that would be painful
for a human to compute.

<br> I've added products and this version works with Maple 10. This
worksheet is pretty well commented, and it will walk you through the
procedures and explain how to use them. <br> <br>

Edwin Evariste Moise (1918-1998) was a topologist, best known for
his proofs of the triangulation theorem and the Hauptvermutang for
topological 3-manifolds.
